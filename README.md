# Source Code for OtterTax Tutorials

This is the source code to accompany the OtterTax video tutorials.  Though
intended as an accompaniment to the tutorials, the code here should also be
useful on its own.

## Prerequisites

You should have a working knowledge of the language whose tutorial you're
following.  All of the code should work with recent versions of the various
languages.  The code was tested on both Linux and Windows with the following
versions of the languages:
- Ruby 2.6.0

## Running the code

For the impatient reader who does not want to watch the tutorials :wink:,
here is a brief list of steps for running the code.
* Register on either the [sandbox](https://sandbox.ottertax.com/register)
  or on the [production](https://api.ottertax.com/register) site.  Be 
  sure to [confirm your registration](https://doc.ottertax.com/registration/registration_confirmation/).
* Clone this repository.
* Create a config.json file.  Use config.json.example to create the file
  by hand (it's a very simple file) or run the appropriate build_config
  program for the language you're using.  For example, ruby users should
  run build_config.rb in the ruby directory.
* Add statements by running the appropriate program for the language you're
  using.  For example, ruby users should run add.rb.
* Run the check program to check the validity of the statements.  Note
  that the data intentionally includes errors to illustrate statement
  validation and correction.
* Run the download program to download and review draft copies of statements.
* Run the correct program to correct statement errors and optionally re-run
  the check program to validate that the errors are no longer reported.
* Run the delete program to delete a single statement.
* Run the finalize program to finalize the statements.  In the production
  environment this removes the draft watermark.  In the sandbox environment,
  finalizing statements has no effect.
* Run the submit program to file statements with the IRS or the Social Security
  Administration (SSA).  Submitting statements in the sandbox environment has
  no effect as statements are not actually submitted.

## Other Resources
* Our [documentation](https://doc.ottertax.com/) site includes full
  documentation for using the API.
* Our [video tutorials](https://vimeo.com/ottertax) walk through using
  the API with various programming languages.
